Big, long & wide tables are a sophisticated sign of power. Where you can find decision makers, market manipulators and dictators, you will also notice their long flat elevated platforms. Oak, teak or even carbon fiber and see through glass, the tables vary in their appearance, and weight. People gather around these, nervously or assertively rest their limbs upon them, and make convincingly important decisions or chatter about others. Sometimes we eat around them, make friends and enemies. A lot of us also earn our livelihood on them. Quite central figures in our lives, aren't they, the tables?

But, as we change our behaviour and environment with an increased acceleration & speed, so does the nature and social environment of tables change. Right now, I'm seated at a quite interesting one. I'll outline why this particular table is interesting in 3 categories:

1. Location & Logistics

Where is this table located? Who can, and who usually sits next to it? These are important questions to ask while examining the nature and habits of a table. This one is located in a Co-Working space. Sounds boring, but the people that sit around it vary a lot for this reason, and days where the composition of humans (& or other furry animals) that accompany the table are the exact same, are few and far between. 

2. Appearance

The table in question with a light wood visual, is a conjunction of several smaller tables. It's more than ~5 meters long, and about 2 meters wide. Quite the Goliath, huh? But there's more important parts to a table's structure than merely size: it's chairs, and other accessories. I count approximately 4 chairs per (longer) side. That's a max occupancy of 8 people. More than enough to invite socializing, or isolation. Some lamps are located in the center with a set distance from each other, and also some power outlets can be found.


3. !People


Arguable the most interesting variables of this table (the other stuff was exciting too, I know), are the people. There's are grand total of 5 right now (including me). 

Straight across from me, sit 2 young males in their late 20s, one decorated by an unglorious H&M sweater, the other with a slightly more exciting hoodie from the software company Reaktor. The hooded villain opens an inconspicuous jar of bland, high protein yogurt, and gulps it with a greed almost so big as his greed for knowledge. Further diatery supplements also make an appearance, an arbitrary bottle of some kind of vitamins. Important to note is that the man wears industry grade ear-protection, probably to block out the mindless chatter of some of the other table-sitters or to surpress the smooth jazz playing subtly in the background. The other man, sporting a beanie, airpods, and a brand-spanking-new MacBook Air 12 inch laptop to match his friends. 

These people are working seemingly hard, probably researching a diverse groups of startups to send cold-emails to, and complaining about a feature in PDFs that prevents one from directly copying text from the document. I do not really wish to categorize them and thus minimize their existance, but this kind of person is growing in number. The go getter. The self made man. The reject. The all so "critical" thinker, that surprisingly agrees with most people on most stuff. Familiarize yourself, because they will expand their influence, their numbers, and maybe even their ideas. 

The other 2 participants sit on the same side as me. They're also young, although female, and blonde. One owns a  brand winterjacket suited for up to -20 degrees celcius, and proudly wears it inside at a room temperature of around 25 degrees celcius. Both come with 13 inch MacBook airs. The girl with the jackets seems to have a complemetary phone stands, and a cute custom mouse next to her green chapstick. Hell, the other one even has an iphone case on the table. No, not a case to wrap your iphone in, this is the actual packaging that originally encased her beloved companion. They discuss branding strategy, and argue about the call to action in an email, I smell a vague hint of resentment in the air. 



This completes my documentation, or analysis of this particular table. Probably no more table-analysis' to come anytime soon. But who knows, I might be off the table a bit.
